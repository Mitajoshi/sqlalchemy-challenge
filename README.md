# sqlalchemy-challenge

All the code files have been uploaded  in the 'SurfsUp' directory found in this repo.

This challenge was a lot of fun to complete. I learned a lot along the way, including data retrieval through SQLAlchemy querries, using Python to manipulate retrieved data, analyize the information and then plot it.
The most fun aspect was to be able to post the above data on a server and be able to respond to client queries through api routes to provide relevant information being sought.
